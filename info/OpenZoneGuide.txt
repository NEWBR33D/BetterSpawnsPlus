// PreyToLive's BetterSpawnsPlus v1.1.0 - Open Zone Guide //

Here you will find all the available open zones for bots to spawn in.
I did my best to locate and determine where each of these open zones occur at in each map. Use the maps from the links below as a
reference of the general areas where the bots roam for each open zone.

Links to all the Tarkov maps I used as a reference:
